  p.question {color:red; font-style:italic;}span.do{color:blue;}span.dont{color:red}
  </style>
<p class="question">General</p>
<p>Companies often desire to introduce their Company and Trade Leads in many languages as much as possible. Automatic translations might likely reflect incorrectly information and messages that Companies want to deliver to customers. More importantly, users hardly search information in automatic translated languages!<br>
Recognising these disavantages, ECizi.com has developped tools to help Companies to post, manage and especially search information easily and quickly in 11 languages. Translators registered in ECizi.com can provide translation services to Companies			
</p>
<p class="question">Role of Ecizi.com on translation services provided by Translators registered in Ecizi.com			
</p>
<p>Ecizi.com is only the platform to connect Company and Translator who will negociate translation fee and conditions by themselves. Requestors (Companies) are responsible to settle fee due to Translators. ECizi.com is not responsible for any disagreement/dispute or unsettlement of translation fee. Supporting tools are also provided to track, follow and manage translation requests				
</p>
<p class="question">How to post Company Information and Trade Leads in different languages			
</p>
<p>Before posting Trade Leads in languages, Company Information must have been already posted in these desired languages! Posting Company Information and Trade leads in languages can be carried out by the Companies themselves or by outsourcing translation to translators registered in ECizi.com (view details in section "posting trade leads")				
</p>
<p class="question">How to outsource translations?			
</p>
<p>" Please be remember that Trade Leads can be posted only in languages where Company Information has been posted already. To outsource translations, follow steps:
<br>
(1) Trade Lead or Company Information is opened (or inputed) in source language<br>
(2) Click botton ""Outsource translation""<br>
(3) Select target language (single selection)<br>
(4) Select appropriate translator<br>
(5) Input requirements/negociation (proposal of translation fee; time to be completed; payment method; message to Translator)<br>
(6) Translator and Requestor would continue to negociate until the request is accepted or denied. If Translator denies the request, Company (Requestor) can send request to an other Translator. If translator accepts the request Company would wait until the translation is completed<br>
(7) When translator completes (finishes) translation, Requestor has to lock (close) translation. As soon as the Translation is closed, Translator can not make any amendment on translation. ECizi Admin will need to approve closed Translation for further public view and usage<br>
(8) Requestor would note on the system payment status of translation fee (paid or not paid yet) to keep track and record"				
</p>
<p class="question">What information can be translated by outsourcing to translators registered in Ecizi.com
</p>
<p>ECizi.com provides supporting tools to track, manage translation outsourcing only for Trade Leads, Company Information but not other information such emails, chats, attachments, files. The outsourcing should be carried out throught email exchanges and it will be recorded, tracked manually by two parties. Companies (Requestors) can also ask Translators to participate chats with partners. However in such cases ECizi.com will not provide supporting tools to track, manage translation outsourcing. Companies (Requestors) and Translators need to manage by themselves for these kinds of translation outsourcing
